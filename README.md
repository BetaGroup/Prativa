# Prativa
Added New Files to gitHub.
Files Included:
1. HighScoreManager.java
2. GameWindow.java
3. ScoreBoard.java
4. ScoreComparator.java

HighScoreManager.java - It opens a text file from disk to read stored (name, score) pair and displays TOP 5 and then identifies the highest. 
TOP 5 is sorted in descending order of score.

HighScoreManager also writes (name,score) data to the text file.

GameWindow.java - Have added a static (name, score) pair value to write to file for testing purpose which would eventually come from player name 
and score acheived by the respective player when we proceed to later phase of this project.
